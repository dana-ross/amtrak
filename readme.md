## Disclaimer
This library and its creator have no relation to Amtrak. Amtrak and the Amtrak Logo are trademarks of The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (NRPC). The API endpoint used is not intended for use outside of [Amtrak's Train Tracking map](https://www.amtrak.com/track-your-train.html). 

## Installation
It'n an NPM package lol:

`npm install amtrak`

## Documentation

[View on Github](https://github.com/pieromqwerty/amtrak/blob/master/docs.md)

## Demo Repl
Here is a demo Repl you can either just simply run or even fork (all in your browser) to see what this library is capable of: https://replit.com/@piemadd/Amtrakjs-Example

## TS Examples
As this library was written in TypeScript, it is naturally easy to use it:
### Fetching All Data
```ts
import { fetchTrainData } from 'amtrak';

//fetches data, cleans it, and then prints to terminal
fetchTrainData().then((trainData) => {
	console.dir(trainData, { depth: null })
})
```
### Fetching All Trains
```ts
import { fetchAllTrains } from 'amtrak';

//fetches all trains and then prints to terminal
fetchAllTrains().then((trainData) => {
	console.dir(trainData, { depth: null })
})
```
### Fetching Single Trains
```ts
import { fetchTrain } from 'amtrak';

//fetches all trains with the number 20 (crescent) and then prints to terminal
fetchTrain(20).then((trainData) => {
	console.dir(trainData, { depth: null })
})
```
### Fetching All Stations
```ts
import { fetchAllStations } from 'amtrak';

//fetches all stations and then prints to terminal
fetchAllStations().then((stationData) => {
	console.dir(stationData, { depth: null })
})
```
### Fetching Single Stations
```ts
import { fetchStation } from 'amtrak';

//fetches all station data for CHI (chicago) and then prints to terminal
fetchStation('CHI').then((stationData) => {
	console.dir(stationData, { depth: null })
})
```

## JS Example
And of course, as the TS is compliled to JS, you can use that as well. The only real difference between the two is how you (generally) import, so everything else is the same. The only difference here is that you can import *from* in ts, but you require the whole module is js.
```js
const amtrak = require("amtrak");
amtrak.fetchTrainData().then((trainData) => {
    console.dir(trainData, { depth: null })
});
```

(wait they're like the same lmao)

## Contributing
I don't currently have any official contributing templates, but please make sure to add some testing code to `testing/src/testAll.ts`. Anything you add should take one of the existing types and return a modified version of it or a new type which you define in `src/types/types.ts`.
